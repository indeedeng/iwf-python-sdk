Python SDK for [iWF workflow engine](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf)

TODO: samples

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+

## How to use

## Concepts

To implement a workflow, the two most core interfaces are

* [Workflow interface](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-python-sdk/blob/main/iwf/workflow.py)
  defines the workflow definition

* [WorkflowState interface](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-python-sdk/blob/main/iwf/workflow_state.py)
  defines the workflow states for workflow definitions

A workflow can contain any number of WorkflowStates.

# Development Plan

## 1.0 -- the basic and most frequently needed features
- [x] Start workflow API
- [x] Executing `wait_until`/`execute` APIs and completing workflow
- [x] Parallel execution of multiple states
- [x] GetWorkflowResultsWithWait API
- [x] StateOption: WaitUntil(optional)/Execute API timeout and retry policy
- [x] Get workflow with wait API
- [x] Timer command
- [x] AnyCommandCompleted and AllCommandCompleted waitingType
- [x] InternalChannel command
- [x] DataAttribute
- [x] Stop workflow API
- [x] Improve workflow uncompleted error return(canceled, failed, timeout, terminated)
- [x] Support execute API failure policy
- [x] Support workflow RPC
- [x] Signal command
- [x] Reset workflow API
- [x] Skip timer API for testing/operation

## Future -- the advanced features that already supported in server. Contributions are welcome to implement them in this SDK!
- [ ] Atomic conditional complete workflow by checking signal/internal channel emptiness
- [ ] Dynamic data/search attributes and internal/signal channel definition
- [ ] State options overridden dynamically
- [ ] Describe workflow API
- [ ] TryGetWorkflowResults API
- [ ] Consume N messages in a single command
- [ ] Decider trigger type: any command combination
- [ ] Failing workflow with results
- [ ] Wait_until API failure policy
- [ ] Caching on persistence
- [ ] StateExecutionLocal
- [ ] SearchAttribute: keyword
- [ ] New search attribute types: Double, Bool, Datetime, Keyword array, Text
- [ ] Workflow start options: initial search attributes
- [ ] Search workflow API
- [ ] Get workflow DataAttributes/SearchAttributes API

### Running iwf-server locally

#### Option 1: use docker compose
See [iwf README](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf#using-docker-image--docker-compose)

#### Option 2: VSCode Dev Container

Dev Container is an easy way to get iwf-server running locally. Follow these steps to launch a dev container:
- Install Docker, VSCode, and [VSCode Dev Container plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
- Open the project in VSCode.
    ```bash
    cd iwf-python-sdk
    code .
    ```
- Launch the Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container command from Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P). You can also click in the bottom left corner to access the remote container menu.
- Once the dev container starts, iwf-server will be listening on port 8801.

## How To Contribute

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependency manager. Check out Poetry's [documentation on how to install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) on your system before proceeding.

> ‚ùóNote: If you use Conda or Pyenv as your environment / package manager, avoid dependency conflicts by doing the following first:
1. Before installing Poetry, create and activate a new Conda env (e.g. conda create -n langchain python=3.9)
2. Install Poetry (see above)
3. Tell Poetry to use the virtualenv python environment (poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true)
4. Continue with the following steps.

To install requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

#### Update IDL
Initialize the IDL Git submodule
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Update IDL to the latest commit.
```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

#### Generate API client from IDL

This project uses [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client) to generate an API client from the IDL. To update the generated client:

```bash
poetry run openapi-python-client update --path iwf-idl/iwf-sdk.yaml --config .openapi-python-client-config.yaml
```
Then update the version in `iwf-api/pyproject.toml` so that poetry can know that the local path dependency package is updated.

Then run `poetry update` to update the local path dependency.
#### Linting

To run linting for this project:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --show-diff-on-failure --color=always --all-files
```
